<p>We also use third-party web analytics tools that help us understand how users engage with our website. These third-parties may use first-party cookies to track user interactions to collect information about how users use our website. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors.

<h5 id="disclosure_personal">5. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>
<p>We may share your information with selected recipients to perform functions required to provide certain Services to you. All such third parties will be contractually bound to protect data in compliance with our Privacy Policy. The categories of recipients include:</p>
<p class="list-type">Companies within the Blockchain corporate family located in the United States and the United Kingdom, in order to provide the Services to you.</p>
<p class="list-type">Cloud service providers to store certain personal data and for disaster recovery services, as well as, for the performance of any contract we enter into with you.</p>

<p>Except where we are required by law to disclose Personal Data, or are exempted from, released from or not subject to any legal requirement concerning the disclosure of Personal Data, we will require any person to whom we provide your Personal Data to agree to comply with our Privacy Policy in force at that time or requirements substantially similar to such policy. We will make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that they comply with such policy or requirements, however, where not expressly prohibited by law, we will have no liability to you, if any person fails to do so.</p>
<p>We shall require any third-party, including without limitation, any government or enforcement entity, seeking access to the data we hold to a court order, or equivalent proof that they are statutorily authorized to access your data and that their request is valid and within their statutory or regulatory power.</p>
<p>Funding and transaction information related to your use of certain Services may be recorded on a public block chain. Public block chains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many block chains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when block chain data is combined with other data.</p>
<p>Because block chains are decentralized or third-party networks that are not controlled or operated by ISLB or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter Personal Data from such networks.</p>

<h5 id="security_personal">6. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h5>
<p>We protect Personal Data with appropriate physical, technological and organizational safeguards and security measures.
    Your Personal Data comes to us via the internet which chooses its own routes and means, whereby information is conveyed from location to location. 
    We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure they are being properly administered and remain effective and appropriate. 
    Every member of Blockchain is committed to our privacy policies and procedures to safeguard Personal Data. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control.

<h5 id="retention_personal">7. RETENTION OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h5>
<p>The length of time we retain Personal Data outside our back-up system varies depending on the purpose for which it was collected and used, as follows:</p>

<p class="list-type">Country location data: while user remains active, stored in the EU.</p>
<p class="list-type">Data on your preferences: while user remains active, stored in the EU.</p>
<p class="list-type">IP address login: until subsequent login from a new IP, stored in the EU.</p>
<p>When Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, we will remove any details that identifies you or we will securely destroy the records, where permissible. However, we may need to maintain records for a significant period of time (after you cease using a particular Service) as mandated by regulation. For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws that require us to retain the following, for a period of five (5) years after our business relationship with you has ended.</p>
<p class="list-type">A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;</p>
<p class="list-type">Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us.</p>
<p>Except where prohibited by law, this period may extend beyond the end of the particular relationship with us, but only for as long as we are bound to do so for the audit, regulatory or other accounting purposes. When Personal Data is no longer needed, we have procedures either to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form. If you have opted-out of receiving marketing communications, we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.</p>
