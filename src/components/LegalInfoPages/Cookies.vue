<h5>1. What is a cookie?</h5>
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a certain webpage. Cookies are then sent back to the originating webpage on each subsequent visit, or to another webpage that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are widely used in order to make the Websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the Website.</p>

<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Websites before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

<p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
<p class="list-type"><b>First party cookies</b>, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device.</p>
<p class="list-type"><b>Third party cookies</b>, which are served by a third party on our behalf. We use third party cookies for [functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes].</p>

<p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are 'permanent cookies', meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by the Websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>

We've set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties set in the following table.</p>

<td>Advertising and Tracking Cookies</td>
<td>	As you use our Websites, you will notice that they feature advertising. We allow third party companies, including advertising companies, to place cookies on our Websites. These cookies enable such companies to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the Internet. These cookies are anonymous -- they store information about the content you are browsing, but not about who you are.
Cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you've seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you've last seen it. This information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.</td>
	<td>All the ad companies or networks that we work with have their own privacy policies and offer a mechanism for users to opt out tracking and behavioral targeting available through the ad itself or through the opt out mechanisms listed in the 'How to control or delete cookies' section below.</td>
</tr> 
<tr>   
<td>Social Media Cookies</td>
<td>	On some pages of our Websites, third parties that provide applications through our Websites may set their own anonymous cookies in order to track the success of their applications or customize applications for you. For example, when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Websites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this. Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us. Some pages of our Websites may also contain embedded content, such as video content from YouTube, and these sites may set their own cookies.</td>
