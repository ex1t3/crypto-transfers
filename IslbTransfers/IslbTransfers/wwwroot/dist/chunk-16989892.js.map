MISCELLANEOUS</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.1\r\n      <i>Force Majeure</i>. If by reason in whole or in part of any Force Majeure Event, either you or ISLB is delayed or prevented from complying with this User Agreement, then such delay or non-compliance shall not be deemed to be a breach of this User Agreement and no loss or damage shall be claimed by you or ISLB by reason thereof. “Force Majeure Event” means any event beyond the party’s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, failure in bank performance, or equipment or software malfunction including network splits or “forks” or unexpected changes in a computer network upon which the Services rely.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.2\r\n      <i>Taxes</i>. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply due to your use of ISLB Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. ISLB is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Virtual Currency transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any virtual currency transactions.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.3\r\n      <i>Severability, Reformation</i>. In the event that any provision of this User Agreement is unenforceable under applicable law, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected. To the extent any provision of this User Agreement is judicially determined to be unenforceable, a court of competent jurisdiction may reform any such provision to make it enforceable. The provisions of this User Agreement will, where possible, be interpreted so as to sustain its legality and enforceability.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.4\r\n      <i>Assignment</i>. This User Agreement shall be binding on your successors, heirs, personal representatives, and assigns. You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this User Agreement without prior written consent of ISLB, which may be withheld in ISLB’s sole discretion. We may assign rights or delegate duties under this User Agreement in our sole discretion.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.5\r\n      <i>Relationship of the Parties</i>. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to, nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship. You and ISLB are independent contractors for purposes of this User Agreement.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.6\r\n      <i>Entire Agreement</i>. This User Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter described herein and shall supersede all prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, among the Parties. Subsequent discussions or negotiations between you and ISLB or ISLB personnel shall only amend or become part of this User Agreement by way of a written amendment specifically referencing the last updated date and name of this User Agreement.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      13.7\r\n      <i>Contact Information</i>.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR UNITED STATES USERS</h5>\r\n    <p>\r\n      14.1\r\n      <i>Disputes</i>. If you live in the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business in the United States), any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner) shall be settled in binding arbitration, in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act under the American Arbitration Association’s rules; provided, however, nothing in this Agreement will waive, preclude or otherwise limit your right to (i) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (ii) file a representative action solely to obtain a public injunction.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      14.2\r\n      <i>Arbitration</i>. The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the county or parish of your billing address, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitration decision may be enforced in any court. You agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order relief, and you agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such a proceeding, which shall be final and conclusive. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>14.3 If the arbitrator(s) or administrator imposes filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. If a court decides that any provision of this section concerning Arbitration is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and resolved in accordance with English law exclusively and the other parts of this section concerning Arbitration shall still apply. In no case shall the remainder of this User Agreement be affected. If the invalidity or unenforceability of a provision causes a dispute to proceed in a court instead of arbitration, the Parties agree that such court must be located in London, England, applying English law.</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      14.4\r\n      <i>No Trial by Jury</i>. By entering into this User Agreement, you expressly waive your right to a trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <h5>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR NON-U.S. USERS</h5>\r\n    <p>15.1 If you live outside of the United States (or, if you are a business, have your principal place of business outside of the United States), \r\n        any dispute arising between you and us under this User Agreement or our relationship (whether arising out of contract, tort, statute or any other manner), \r\n        the courts located in Tallin, Estonia shall have exclusive jurisdiction of such dispute, and will hear the dispute under Estonian law.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nimport Title from \"./TitleBlock.vue\";\r\nimport Legal from \"../../views/LegalInfo\";\r\nexport default {\r\n  extends: Legal,\r\n  components: {\r\n    Title\r\n  },\r\n  beforeMount() {\r\n      this.$parent.titleObj.name = \"ISLB User Agreement\";\r\n      this.$parent.titleObj.lastUpdate = \"November 8, 2019\";\r\n      this.$parent.titleObj.downloadLink = \"https://pay.islb.one/il-doc/islb_terms.pdf\"\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n</script>","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./TermsOfUse.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
